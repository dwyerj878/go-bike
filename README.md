# Bike-Go

## Overview
The application is intended to take an activity file and generate statistics such as normalized power and training effects based purely on the athlete and sample data.

Initially it is using json format as exported by Golden Cheetah but the intent is to support multiple inout formats and create a consistent output that will work in garmin connect, golden cheetah etc.

## Technology
* The initial implenmentation is using go 1.23.4

## TODO
- [x] load json gc file
- [ ] load xml garmin file
- [x] athlete data
- [ ] normalized power
- [ ] training effect
- [ ] time in zones
- [ ] graph output
